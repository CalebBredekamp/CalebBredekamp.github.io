# Github Page for Caleb Bredekamp

## Intention

This should allow for the replacement of the ssmd tool by using an existing service from
something we already use. Hopefully this simplifies things somewhat.

## Goals

- Include a golang (godoc), java (javadoc) and another with pure markdown documentation.
- In the markdown, tag some release versions and see if you
  can separately maintain these without a multitude of different branches.
